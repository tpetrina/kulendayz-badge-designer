We’ll compare them by measuring execution time, and after that we’ll be able to make an informed decisions on how to improve performance. Additionally, in some cases memory usage will be measured and compared. It’s recommended to measure execution time after every optimization step because it is possible that something that (only) looks like a good optimization will not result in significant performance improvement. Actually, sometime result can be a slower code, and we’ll see an example of this in a demo. We’ll discuss best practices for writing faster C# code and code that allocates less memory.",

In case of odd entries, the last team that runs out of pair will automatically continue to the next round. Acronym Fight is conducted as a two-by-two team competition. Each team member in a duel draws one acronym from the set of all acronyms. A team member has 3 seconds to decipher an acronym. The correct answer is the one on the list of all acronyms (because it is possible to distinguish one acronym into several expressions). The winner is the team that has more points. In case of an equal result, the team members draw one additional question in the same sequence until a difference is made. The winning team goes on to the next round.

In addition, these associations might also be a preliminary analysis for advanced methods. There are many methods for measuring the associations, depending also on the type of the variables – discrete or/and continuous ones. This session introduces measures of association from statistics and information theory. You will learn how to present and notice associations with advanced graphs and how to measure the strength and compare the strength of those associations with code in R.",

      "SQL Server has numerous options for tightening the security in all stages of a database lifecycle, starting with preparing a secure environment. SQL Server helps you configuring minimal surface area and assess the vulnerabilities of your database. Then you continue with defining the core permissions in your database – who can see and who can modify which part of it. You can enhance the security by using the programmable objects. SQL Server also enables very detailed column-level and row-level predicate permissions. Encrypting the data can be done in different ways, including the Always Encrypted option, where even the database administrator (DBA) cannot see the data. Instead of encrypting, you can also dynamically mask data.\nPreventing data leaks is one part of a secure system. Auditing access to the data might be equally important. SQL Server gives you auditing capabilities out of the box. You can also track all changes of the data and get the state of the data in any time point in the past with system versioned tables. Finally, you can also classify your data in order to inform users that they are dealing with sensitive data.\n",

It is no longer just a matter of AI causing the loss of jobs where repetitive work prevails (e.g., on the assembly line in a factory). There are also examples of application in creative human activities - e.g., art (where AI creates a work of art). The question arises: if and when AI will replace developers? Will AI help solve the labor shortage in the IT sector? What role does AI play in software development today, and how can it help developers?\nAttend this session, watch real life development demos, join the discussion on this exciting topic, and learn how AI is already involved in developing IT solutions such as GitHub Copilot!",

Although this challenge, which has faced humankind for centuries, may not be completely solvable in our time, we have come astonishingly closer than our ancestors through the innovations brought about by e.g. Blockchain technology.\nOne of the most important principles of blockchain systems is their decentralized nature and the resulting need to reach a consensus without relying on a central body (trusted by everyone) that will tell the truth.\nCome, let's talk about how to reach consensus between systems, and learn about consensus algorithms, and how they work.

      "\nSQL Server has numerous options for tightening the security in all stages of a database lifecycle, starting with preparing a secure environment. SQL Server helps you configuring minimal surface area and assess the vulnerabilities of your database. Then you continue with defining the core permissions in your database – who can see and who can modify which part of it. You can enhance the security by using the programmable objects. SQL Server also enables very detailed column-level and row-level predicate permissions. Encrypting the data can be done in different ways, including the Always Encrypted option, where even the database administrator (DBA) cannot see the data. Instead of encrypting, you can also dynamically mask data.\nPreventing data leaks is one part of a secure system. Auditing access to the data might be equally important. SQL Server gives you auditing capabilities out of the box. You can also track all changes of the data and get the state of the data in any time point in the past with system versioned tables. Finally, you can also classify your data in order to inform users that they are dealing with sensitive data.",

So, let's demystify it and answer questions like what artificial intelligence is, what the dominant approaches are, where we are today and what's coming in the next 2-3 years, and what are the business implications. This session aims to clear the fog in front of technology (or, more precisely, a combination of technologies and patterns and practices) that promises to change the world that we know today, once and for all.
